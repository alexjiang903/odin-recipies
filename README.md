This is project 1 of Odin Fundamentals Course.

I never formally learned how to write/understand HTML/CSS up till now (just winged everything) so I thought this would be my chance to actually build up my fundamental knowledge ground up in web dev before learning how to run with more complex projects. 

It's quite humbling to learning HTML from scratch after I've already taken DSA and other complex logic-heavy programming courses, but also extremely rewarding knowing that I am building my knowledge in something fundamental all by myself.
