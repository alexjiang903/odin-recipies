    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, 
        and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs
         tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure 
         the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Spaghetti (storebought or homemade)</li>
        <li>3 Eggs</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese (sub for parmesan if not available)</li>
        <li>Guanciale (sub for bacon or pancetta if not available)</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pork (Guanciale or other substitute from above) in olive oil until browned and crispy, then drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy.</li>
        <li>Stir in the pork, then top with the remaining cheese and more black pepper.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask somebody to hold the pot so you can stir pasta quickly while pouring the egg mixture over it.</li>
        <li>Optionally, add in a couple spoons of reserved pasta water into the sauce to emulsify it better.</li>
