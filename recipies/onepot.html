    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy sausage orzo skillet is a one pot-and-done comfort food dish. 
    It can easily be doubled, and you can use any sausage you like. It is delicious! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons olive or avocado oil</li>
        <li>4 italian sausages, sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>4 ounces orzo pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>4 large basil leaves, shredded (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy bottom pot over medium-low heat and drizzle in oil.
             Fry sausage rounds until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. 
             Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Add orzo and cook and stir until lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. 
            Pour in chicken broth and 1/2 cup  cream. Stir in salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, 
            and chili flakes.</li>

        <li>Bring mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer until orzo is very tender, 
            about 10 minutes. Check occasionally; add additional cream as needed if 
            orzo becomes too dry before it is tender.</li>

        <li>Lower heat to low, then stir in basil and Parmesan until fully incorporated. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
